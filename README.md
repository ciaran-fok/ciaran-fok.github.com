# Ciaran Fok and Noam Fok's Public Notebook

On this public notebook we post our reading reports and lecture notes on neuroscience, psychology, computer science, comedy, and all kinds of fun stuff. It is built under Ciaran's Github directory but it is used by both of us, Ciaran and Noam.

The site is developed by a common friend of ours, Murcline. Thanks, Mur!
Go check out her repository if you're interested, here's the link. (Feel free to check it out, but there's really nothing there yet. -- M)
