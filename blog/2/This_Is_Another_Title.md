“I immediately knew Liza was the one,” O’Brien told me earlier. “I couldn’t say, Oh no, I’m not ready — I need to be with a few drug-addicted super-models with rage issues. It’s my nature to be the opposite of a self-destructive person: something inside of me usually makes me do the right thing.” This applies to the show as well. Unlike Letterman and Carson, O’Brien doesn’t seem to have a dark side. His humor is not mean — he’d rather laugh with the audience than at them. And unlike Stewart, he’s not on TV to educate through mockery. It’s impossible, for instance, to imagine O’Brien sparring with someone like Jim Cramer, the CNBC money guru, as Stewart recently did. O’Brien is too respectful to be angry; like Leno, he works hard to be polite.

## Heading 2
Ideas were starting to take shape, too, many of them inspired by the back lot itself. “Jaws” was a huge hit for Universal, and one writer suggested that Bruce, the mechanical shark, could occasionally drop by the show. “In our mind, he sounds like Paul Lynde,” O’Brien explained. 
## Heading 2
“He dishes dirt about his co-stars.” The show had an exact replica of O’Brien’s desk built onto the front of a golf cart and, later that day, O’Brien was scheduled to take a short road trip through the studio. “We’re going to drive up to the ‘Psycho’ house and try and interview Norman Bates at the desk,” O’Brien said. “And maybe we’ll take a break during 1869 in Western Town. And then we’ll swing by the ‘Desperate Housewives’ set and try to see Eva Longoria in her trailer for an interview.

### Heading 3
Here lets' add some code
```c++
#include <stdio.h>

int main {
	cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
	return 0;
} 
```

#### Heading 4
Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God.
- List item 3 

This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world.

“He showed up with really high hair and an actor’s attitude,” says Dinello. “Sedaris and I were more like clowns. We tried to corrupt him.”
#### Heading 4
It didn’t take long for them to succeed. “As soon as he realized he could relax on stage, he got more playful and became sillier and sillier,” Sedaris says. Even though Colbert remained tom for several more years between comedy and “straight” acting—on several occasions, Sedaris and Dinello had to persuade him to come back to Second City after he’d quit to do what he thought of as serious theater—he came to embrace his comedic and improvisational skills.

The Report (pronounced with a soft t, as is Colbert) debuted in the fall of 2005 as a spin-off of Comedy Central’s The Daily Show, the critical and popular success that’s often referred to by its host, Jon Stewart, as a “fake news” show. Stewart has turned The Daily Show into a cultural touchstone in the eight years he’s been there, and has become such an icon that he hosted the Academy Awards in 2006.

But The Colbert Report couldn’t take a page from its forebearer’s playbook. Stewart plays himself on TV—a smart, witty, liberal Jew who’s alternately amused and enraged by the political realities of our time—and a large part of The Daily Show’s popularity stems from his personal appeal.
